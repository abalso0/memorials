## Sharone Revah Zitzman

Sefi Genis was not only a community persona and figure, always contributing and sharing from his wealth of knowledge with the [#tlvcommunity](https://tlvcommunity.dev) and the global DevOps & Cloud Native community, he was also a friend.
In Judaism we believe that every person lost is an entire world lost with them, and this is so befitting to describe the loss of Sefi to our community.
His professionalism, technological domain expertise, wisdom beyond his years, and most of all his kindness, wit and humor have been stolen from all of us through this heinous terror attack on October 7th.
Sending love and light to his family and friends, may his soul be intwined in the chain of life, and his memory be a blessing.
