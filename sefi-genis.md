## Sharone Revah Zitzman

Sefi Genis was not only a community persona and figure, always contributing and sharing from his wealth of knowledge with the [#tlvcommunity](https://tlvcommunity.dev) and the global DevOps & Cloud Native community, he was also a friend.
In Judaism we believe that every person lost is an entire world lost with them, and this is so befitting to describe the loss of Sefi to our community.
His professionalism, technological domain expertise, wisdom beyond his years, and most of all his kindness, wit and humor have been stolen from all of us through this heinous terror attack on October 7th.
Sending love and light to his family and friends, may his soul be intwined in the chain of life, and his memory be a blessing. 

## Gal Cohen
Sefi was an exceptional individual, always willing to share his knowledge, helping others, all the while in his unique way of making everyone feel comfortable.
He was known for the most generous heart, his ever-present smile, hearty laughter, and his knack for injecting humor into any situation.
Sefi inspired all of us. 
Taught us that there are no boundaries 
Always keep pushing forward. 
Taught us the meaning of defication and innovation.
Sefi will always stay in our hearts, remembered for the best moments of true caring friendship.
