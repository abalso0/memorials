I had the privilege of working with Rodo on multiple initiatives over the past few years,
and I want to share just a few of the many things that made him the extraordinary person he was.

First and foremost was his true community spirit.
Guadalajara is well known for its vibrant tech communities, inspired by Silicon Valley models.
Rodo, who grew up in Mexico City, decided early in his career to move to Guadalajara to pursue his dream of being part of this thriving ecosystem.

He co-founded the Go Lang community and played a key role in reviving the Cloud Native community.
Not stopping there, he was instrumental in organizing both Kubernetes Community Days (KCDs)
in Guadalajaraâ€”taking the lead on the second one until leukemia forced him to step back.
His active contributions to translating the CNCF glossary and Kubernetes documentation into Spanish were essential in achieving those projects' success.

I learned many things from himâ€”not only as a professional but, more importantly, as a friend.
His passing is a tremendous loss for the CNCF LATAM community.
We will deeply miss him. I hope his family, like so many of us, will find strength in his legacy and the lives he touched.

I met Rodolfo through his contributions to the Kubernetes documentation, especially in translating from English to Spanish. I was impressed by his strong focus on community and his mindset of always delivering excellent work.
I had the opportunity to attend one of his talks alongside VÃ­ctor Morales in Guadalajara, Mexico, and it was inspiring to see all that they achieved together in the Spanish translation community.

Rodolfo was collaborative, diligent caring for his team, always contributing, providing, and striving for something better, all with an incredible smile and humility.

Rodolfo, I will always remember you for what you were: a great human being and an example to follow.

My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.

Thank you for evertything, Rodolfo and rest in peace. ðŸŒ¹

Rodolfo had a profound impact and was a true inspiration in how he shared his knowledge, time, dedication, and charisma with the community.

I first met him while working on the Kubernetes Spanish localization team alongside VÃ­ctor. He was always there to support and help everyone, making a real differenceâ€”especially for beginners or newcomers to the group.

He actively contributed to Kubernetes releases and inspired me to apply as well. He never hesitated to answer my questions, no matter how small.

After almost three years together in the Spanish localization team, Rodolfo became not just a colleague but a friend. It was a joy to meet him in person at several Kubecons, the last time in Salt Lake Cityâ€”where we spoke, as always, about how to collaborate and support the Latin American community.

We will deeply miss his presence. Until the very end, he was contributing, answering questions, and merging pull requests for the community.

Those of us who had the privilege to know him will never forget his kindness and his unwavering dedication to helping others.

Rest in peace, Rodolfo. My heartfelt condolences and a warm embrace to his family and friends during this difficult time.

From where you are, you will always be an inspiration, and we will strive to follow in your footsteps.

ðŸ–¤ **In Memory of Rodolfo Martinez Vega â€“ Rodo** ðŸ–¤

Today, my heart and the entire **Cloud Native LATAM** community are in mourning. Weâ€™ve lost a dear friend, colleague, and true community leader: **Rodolfo Martinez Vega**, **CNCF Ambassador**, whose active work in translating the **CNCF glossary** and **Kubernetes documentation into Spanish** was key to the success of those projects and to making knowledge accessible to thousands of developers across the region.

Rodo was one of the first to believe in initiatives like *La Hora de Kubernetes*. His help in the translation tag for Kubernetes documentation â€”and so many other projectsâ€” was fundamental. He was always ready to contribute, invite others to join, and inspire people to follow his lead.

I met him in person at **KubeCon Amsterdam 2023**, and from then on we shared so many moments: **KCD MedellÃ­n, El Salvador, Guadalajara**â€¦ The last time we saw each other was at **KubeCon Salt Lake 2024**, where we spent three days each fighting for our causes â€”he for **KCD Guadalajara** and I for Colombia. Iâ€™ll never forget that cold night outside the convention center, both of us with dead phones, sitting on the stairs charging from a portable battery, swapping stories, dreams, and life plans. Those memories are treasures Iâ€™ll carry in my heart.

He spoke at our **Fellowship by Cloud Native LATAM**, I met his fiancÃ©e, and we shared personal and professional moments that made me admire him even more. One of his biggest wishes was to overcome leukemia and be able to contribute to open source again â€”something he was truly passionate about.

Rodo, the LATAM community and our ambassadorsâ€™ group will miss you so much. Thank you for your friendship, your example, and your generosity.

Vuela alto Rodo! ðŸ–¤
